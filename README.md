# Data Visualisation
- This project is based on a Hans RÃ¶sling Ted-Talk presentation which contains an animated plot.
- The x-axis of the plot is the child survival rate, where a child is defined as being below 5 years.
- The y-axis is the fertility rate which is described as the number of children per woman.
- Most countries are illustrated and with a size corresponding to the population.
- The animation arises form the years ranging from 1960 to 2015.

- the link to the original presentation is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTznEIZRkLg&t=23s

- enclosed is the notebook with all the code as well as the output gif resulting from the code.

# Necessary Structure 
- To run this file, it is essential to have this data structure with the folder "pics" under the folder data" and the py file to be on the same level as the data folder. If one merely wants to see the result, this can be achieved by running the output.gif attached. The py file, however, allows for the creation of the file.

# Requirements.txt
- The attached requirement.txt includes all necessary libraties.
